            <td>1. When a hard drive makes unusual noises (such as clicks, grinding, whining, etc.), it usually indicates a physically failing hard drive, especially if the drive has started malfunctioning or generating errors. If this is the case, the drive should be replaced.
                I am afraid that your hard drive is out of warranty since 11/21/2021. I suggest taking the drive to a local computer shop as they usually provide repairing services. If you have data on the drive, we would friendly recommend taking the device to a data recovery lab near your area to see if they are able to recover your information there.
                <br><br>
                2. I’m sorry to inform you that if the drive is out of warranty, it won’t be eligible for replacement as per Seagate’s policy. I understand this may be disappointing, and I appreciate your understanding.

5.Type the command line: sudo mkdir /Volume/usb. Repalce “usb” with the name of your disk that will not mount. Enter admin password if required to execute this command.<br><br>
6.Continue to type: sudo mount -t hfs /dev/disk1 /Volumes/usb into the window and execute it. Please note that “disk1” is just an example here. You should also replace the number with your own disk when operating.<br><br>
7.Check to see if the disk is now mounted on Mac desktop or in the Finder.<br><br>

			In general, an I/O Device Error (short for Input/output Device Error) usually happens on external & internal hard drives, SD cards, SSDs, USB flash drives, CDs, or DVDs while you are trying to read or copy data in Windows 10/8/7. Most times, it will display "The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error" message.<br><br>
 
How to fix I/O device error on an external/internal hard drive?<br><br>
 
First, fix I/O device error in command prompt or by changing the transfer mode for the drive. Second, recover data from I/O device error.<br><br>
 
Method 1. Fix I/O device error in Command Prompt
1. Press "Windows" Key and type: cmd to open the menu, right-click "Command Prompt" and choose 'Run as administrator' option.<br>
2. Click "Yes" when you are presented with a window requesting permission to launch the Command Prompt as Administrator.<br>
3. In the new Command Prompt window, type: chkdsk E: /f /r /x (replace E with the drive letter for your device).<br>
 <br><br>
This option will run the chkdsk function to check and repair disk errors on the hard drive, USB drive, or other storage devices to fix I/O device error. And then you will no longer have to deal with the "The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error" prompt.<br><br>
 
Method 2. Fix I/O device error by changing the transfer mode in IDE Channel Properties
 <br><br>
1. Press Windows+X to open the menu, then select Device Manager.<br>
2. Expand IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers. A subset will open, listing the different IDE ATA/ATAPI channels for the computer.<br>
3. Right-click the channel where the appropriate drive is connected, and then click Properties. Typically, this channel is Secondary IDE Channel.<br>
4. On the Advanced Settings tab, select PIO Only in the Transfer Mode box for the device that represents the appropriate drive. Typically, this is Device 0. Then, click OK and exit all windows.<br>
5. Test the drive and check if "The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error" message has been removed.<br>
